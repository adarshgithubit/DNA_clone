The film, which was released on May 20, is still drawing the audience to the theatres even in its fourth week. The Kartik Aaryan starrer collected Rs 1.29 crore on its 26th day bailing Bollywood out of troubled waters as very few Hindi films have managed to put up good numbers at the box office in recent times except for the runaway success of The Kashmir Files. Senior film trade analyst Taran Adarsh on Tuesday shared the Kartik Aaryan-starrer film's collection in his tweet. '#BhoolBhulaiyaa2 is super-steady... Is performing like the pre-pandemic times, which is creditworthy... [Week 4] Fri 1.56 cr, Sat 3.01 cr, Sun 3.45 cr, Mon 1.30 cr, Tue 1.29 cr. Total: ₹ 173.76 cr. #India biz.,' he wrote."

  description:"After Akshay Kumar's Samrat Prithviraj flopped badly at the box office, there were rumours in the industry that the big-budget action-packed entertainer Bade Miyan Chote Miyan starring Akshay and Tiger Shroff has been shelved. Now, its director Ali Abbas Zafar has dismissed all the rumours calling them 'absolutely baseless'. Talking to Hindustan Times, Ali said, ‘This is absolutely baseless. We are very much on track and there’s no truth to the shelving rumours. We are currently working on the pre-production. I don’t know where these rumours are coming from. For a film of this large scale, months of pre-production is needed. We will go on floors by the end of this year or early next year and shoot in the UK’.Also, while talking to ETimes, the director has said that Bade Miyan Chote Miyan is a completely new film and has nothing to do with the old one with which it shares its title. The David Dhawan-directed 1998 comedy starred Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda with both the actors playing double roles. It was in February when the film was announced with a teaser video featuring the two stars that also mentioned its release date as Christmas 2023. The film will clash with Shah Rukh Khan-Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki which is scheduled to release on December 22, 2023.",

      description:"After losing the trial against Johnny Depp, Amber Heard talked about her experience in a recent interview. The actress opened up on the trolls who targeted Amber on social media and in the real world. During an interview with NBS’S Savannah Guthrie, the 36-year-old actress said, ‘Every single day, I passed three, four, sometimes six blocks, city blocks lined with people holding signs saying, ‘Burn the witch’, ‘Death to Amber’.’ ‘After three and a half weeks, I took the stand, and saw just a courtroom packed full of Captain Jack Sparrow fans who were vocal, energized…. This was the most humiliating and horrible thing I’ve ever been through. I have never felt more removed from my own humanity. I felt less than human,’ she stated. Amber believes, ‘the vast majority of this trial was played out on social media. I think that this trial is an example of that gone haywire, gone amok. The jury’s not immune to that. She added, ‘even the most well-intentioned juror, it would have been impossible to avoid this.’ She said, ‘I spoke up against sexual violence—and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change. I would not blame the average person for looking at this and how it’s been covered and not think that it is Hollywood brats at their worst. But what people don’t understand is that it’s actually so much bigger than that.’ On being asked if Depp’s team ‘had better lawyers,’ Heard replied, ‘I will say his lawyers did a certainly better job of distracting the jury from the real issues’. On being asked about tapes that showed the rough side of the actress, she said, ‘I did do and say horrible, regrettable things throughout my relationship. I behaved in horrible, almost unrecognizable to myself ways. I have so much regret.’",

Recently, when South star Sai Pallavi attended an event to promote her upcoming film Virata Parvam, she faced a similar situation where she was almost mobbed by fans. We say almost because it was her Virata Parvam co-star Rana Daggubati who turned bouncer for her and protected her from getting pulled in the crowd or hurt as enthusiastic fans tried to click photos with her. This wasn't the first Virata Parvam event where fans of Sai Pallavi got over-enthusiastic. Earlier too, Sai faced a similar situation where despite her bodyguard keeping excited fans at an arms-length,  Rana Daggubati had to step in and protect the actress from her sea of fans. In a now-viral video that is circulating on social media, Sai Pallavi is seen addressing her fans during a promotional event for her upcoming film Virata Parvam. Rana, on the other hand, is seen stopping fans from going close to Sai Pallavi by raising his arms and making a protective shield around her. In what seems like a fan-edited video of instances where Rana turned bodyguard for Sai, the actor is seen being protective of his co-star multiple times, stopping fans from barging in. In another instance in the video, Rana is seen holding an umbrella for his Virata Parvam co-star. The video has gone viral online and Rana Daggubati is being hailed as a gentleman while his sweet gesture to not let harm come in his co-star's way, has won a million hearts. ",

  description:"The House of Cards star Kevin Spacey is set to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday morning as he gets charged with four counts of sexual assault in UK with an additional charge of ‘causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent’, the Metropolitan Police have confirmed. The four historic assaults are alleged to have been perpetrated against three men, now in their 30s and 40s, between 2005 and 2013, a period during which Spacey served as artistic director of the Old Vic theatre. The Met Police have said the incidents were alleged to have taken place in London and Gloucestershire, reports Variety. According to Variety, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the UK version of the D.A., spent over a year reviewing the evidence before confirming last month they had authorised police to press charges. In a statement to Good Morning America, Spacey said he would voluntarily surrender himself to U.K. police to be charged before defending himself in court. Spacey said in a statement accessed by Variety, ‘I very much appreciate the Crown Prosecution Service's statement in which they carefully reminded the media and the public that I am entitled to a fair trial, and innocent until proven otherwise.’ ‘While I am disappointed with their decision to move forward, I will voluntarily appear in the UK as soon as can be arranged and defend myself against these charges, which I am confident will prove my innocence’, the actor further said in his statement. The UK charges are the latest in a long line of legal battles - both civil and criminal - for Spacey after allegations were first made about him in 2017. Spacey was the toast of television for his role in Netflix flagship series House of Cards until Anthony Rapp told Buzzfeed News of historic allegations against Spacey.",
