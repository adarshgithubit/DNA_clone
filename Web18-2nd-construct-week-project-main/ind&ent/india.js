The sensors are linked to the KDMC's Smart City Operation Centre, where the water levels are monitored round-the-clock.Once the water level set specifically (as alarming) is reached, the centre gets an alert following which the civic body's disaster management team can take action to alert citizens or take any other preventive measure as required, KDMC Commissioner Dr Vijay Suryavanshi said. The sensors have been installed at 10 specific locations where flooding occurs frequently, he said. He claimed that this new system has, perhaps, been installed for the first time in any civic limits to prevent a disaster and losses due to flooding. In addition to this, the officials concerned will keep the civic team informed about problems arising due to the rise in water level in different areas, especially at vulnerable locations, he added."

This year's election is scheduled for July 18 and the counting of votes will take place on July 21 as President Ram Nath Kovind's five-year tenure comes to an end on July 24. After the notification is issued on June 15, nomination papers can be filed and June 29 will be the last date for this. Here we go down the memory lane to know how the Presidential Election started in India and what happened during that time. The Election Commission announced the election date on April 12, 1952. After this the process began. Voting took place on May 2, 1952 and the results were declared on May 6, 1952. Dr Rajendra Prasad was the official candidate of Congress in this election. No party had fielded its candidate against him. However, four independent candidates were definitely in the fray. The most serious candidate in this was KT Shah, who himself had been in the Constituent Assembly and had earned a name in Indian politics.Besides, Lakshman Ganesh Thatte and Chowdhry Hari Ram were also in the fray as independent candidates. Krishna Kumar Chatterjee was the fourth independent candidate to stand against Dr Rajendra Prasad.Who was KT Shah? Khushal Talaksi Shah had made a mark as an Indian economist and lawyer. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India when the Indian Constitution was being made. He was recognised as an active socialist leader. He was educated at the London School of Economics.KT Shah was practicing law in Mumbai since 1914. He was the main opponent against Dr Rajendra Prasad. He got 15.3% of the votes in that election. Shah was the first person who wanted to have the word secular in our Constitution. This was added later by Indira Gandhi through a constitutional amendment."

Though global warming is one of the main reasons for the phenomenon, it is not the only culprit. According to a study, published in the peer-reviewed Geophysical Research Letters Journal in March, groundwater extraction, mining, reclamation of natural wetlands, infrastructure projects and ecological disturbances is leading to land subsidence in Mumbai.The study titled “Subsidence in Coastal Cities Throughout the World” reads, “Mumbai is the seventh-most populous city in the world with a population of roughly 20 million. A significant portion of the city is subsiding more rapidly than 2 mm/yr.'The observation has been made after measuring the subsidence rate in Mumbai between 2015 and 2020. “A densely populated and irregularly constructed slum area along the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road merging with the Sion-Panvel Expressway also shows subsidence in the range of 60mm over the same period,' the study adds."

Eleven-year-old Rahul Sahu became cynosure of all eyes after he was rescued from the borewell in a village in Jangir-Champa district on late Tuesday night as people across the country, which has seen numerous such incidents in the past, heaved a collective sigh of relief. It was an arduous task for rescuers to dig an over 60-feet-deep parallel pit and create a tunnel to reach Rahul Sahu who fell into the borewell on Friday, but neither the rescuers gave up nor the boy lost his patience. In the end, it was a happy moment and a sigh of relief for the boy's parents, locals and over 500 rescuers from various agencies who battled several odds and raced against time to save the boy after a 104-hour-long operation. Television visuals showed the boy on a stretcher with rescuers carrying it on their shoulders from the mouth of the tunnel to an ambulance stationed nearby. As the boy was brought out of the tunnel around midnight on Tuesday, thousands of people who had gathered at the spot applauded the rescuers and burst into chants of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’. Rahul Sahu was rushed to a hospital in Bilaspur by creating a green corridor for about 100 km. His condition is stable and he will recover soon, an official from the Jangir-Champa district administration said. His emotional father Ram Kumar Sahu thanked all those involved in the rescue operation. The boy showed remarkable patience and did not panic, which gave strength to rescue teams, a district administration official said. The boy fell into the unused 80-feet-deep borewell, located in the backyard of his house in Pihrid village in Malkharoda development block, around 2 pm last Friday while he was playing there. He was stuck at a depth of around 60-feet below the surface. After being alerted, local administration and police swung into action and rescue efforts began at 4 pm. ",
